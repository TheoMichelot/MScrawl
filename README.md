# State-switching continuous-time correlated random walk

This R package implements an MCMC algorithm for inference into the state-switching continuous-time correlated random walk. 

## Example

The simulation function simIOU and the estimation function runMCMC are demonstrated in the demo file [MScrawl_sim.R](https://github.com/TheoMichelot/MScrawl/blob/master/demo/MScrawl_sim.R).
